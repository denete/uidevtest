Using the provided feed data, construct a page that is formatted to match the included mockups.

The page layout should be responsive and render as multi-column (uidevtest/mockup-wide.jpg) for viewports greater than 480 pixels and as single-column (uidevtest/mockup.jpg) below that breakpoint.

h2. Feed Data

Your page should load data from the provided datafile.

uidevtest/src/js/uidevtest-data.js

h2. URLs and story rendering

The page should render one of the five stories when accessed by the urls below.

uidevtest/src/html/index.html?story=01
uidevtest/src/html/index.html?story=02
uidevtest/src/html/index.html?story=03
uidevtest/src/html/index.html?story=04
uidevtest/src/html/index.html?story=05

h2. Design Attributes

The social links ("Comment", "Share", "Favorite", and "Vote") have full-color sprite icons (uidevtest/src/images/uidevtest-sprite.png). They should display on the page as grayscale icons. Upon mouse-over (hover), they should display as full-color icons. Upon mouse-out, they should return to grayscale state.
